        <h2> Why is Dr. Doge different ?</h2>
        <p>Dr. Doge is here to help. The initial goal of Dr. Doge 
            is to help pay off as many GoFundMes as possible. 
            This feature will be implemented at launch. Those who buy / sell
            will be giving away a percentage of their coins to be stored into 
            a separate wallet. That wallet will convert BNB to USDC then over 
            a VISA card offered by Crypto.com. That money will be sent at random 
            to the GoFundMes we have selected.

            The community is tired of scam coins as well as coins created that serve no purpose. 
            Individuals who speak in circles 
            without actually answering your questions? 
            Individuals are creating coins without any knowledge 
            of blockchain.
